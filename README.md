# Default Template

This is the default template for creating `@agmajs/script` scripts.

## Usage

To build the script:
```bash
# Default building
npm run build

# Building minified
npm run build:tiny
```

Once built you can find the code in `dist/build.js`. Copy that code and put it in a new TamperMonkey script.
